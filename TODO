 - Remove `AsyncRuntime`
 - Can we distill the executor/connection types into a single one
 - Break `httpz` out into an independant crate
 - Break `tauri` integration into an indepdendant crate

 - Make the batch and single executor the same thing without a performance cost????

 - Axum, Cloudflare Workers and Lambda crate

 - Drop rspc `Error` and rely on that being done in user-space
 - Can we drop mw mapper API while still having a solution for Spacedrive???

 - Can `Executor` and `BuiltRouter` be merged into the same thing

 - Properly capture panics in procedures
 - A macro for easily calling rspc procedures in unit test-style senarioes + use it internally for testing.

 - Which types should stay in `internal` vs be made public? Eg. `exec` should probs not be in it

 - Can we drop official tracing integration and instead have hooks and some generic `T` for holding the span somewhere

 - Unit testing panics with procedures and checking they actually always resolve and catch the panic internally -> Super important they are catched when we get to batching
