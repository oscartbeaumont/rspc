# rspc

rspc is a typesafe router allowing you to build end-to-end type safe APIs. You define your backend logic in a Rust function and use the Typescript client to call it. Your rspc router is transport agnostic which means you can serve it from any HTTP server of your choice such as [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) or even from [Tauri](https://tauri.app).
