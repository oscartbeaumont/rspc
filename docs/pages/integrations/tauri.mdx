title: Tauri Integration
---

# Tauri

rspc has a built-in integration with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) so that you can expose your API to your frontend code using Tauri's IPC.

### Enable feature

For the integration to work you must enable the `tauri` feature of rspc. Ensure the rspc line in your `Cargo.toml` file looks like the following:

```toml /rspc_tauri = "0.0.0"/ copy filename="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
rspc = "0.0.0"
rspc-tauri = "0.0.0"
```

Read more about Rust features [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features)

### Usage

Then expose your router using the Tauri plugin.

```rs copy filename="src/main.rs"
let router = <Router>::new().build();

tauri::Builder::default()
    .plugin(rspc_tauri::plugin(router.arced(), |app_handle| ()))
```

### Usage on frontend

```ts copy filename="index.ts"
import { createClient } from "@rspc/client";
import { TauriTransport } from "@rspc/tauri";
import type { Procedures } from "./ts/bindings"; // These were the bindings exported from your Rust code!

const client = createClient<Procedures>({
  transport: new TauriTransport(),
});

client.query(["version"]).then((data) => console.log(data));
```

You can use the `client` by itself or integrate with the [Tanstack Query](/client/tanstack-query) hooks.
